# Research-Profile
I’m a biological oceanographer interested in marine plankton ecology, the role they play in global biogeochemical cycling, and what mechanisms structure plankton communities. My interdisciplinary academic journey started at Texas A&M University (2011 – 2015) where I completed a double major (B.S. Biology, Geology) and a minor in oceanography. Thereafter, I immediately started my Ph. D. in the Ocean Sciences program at the University of Southern California (USC: 2015 – 2021) in Professor Doug Capone’s lab. Upon completion of my Ph. D. in 2021, I joined Professor Jed Fuhrman’s laboratory at USC to begin the next phase of my career in marine plankton ecology. At the beginning of 2024, I joined Professor Mick Follows’ Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to interface ocean models with empirical observations (i.e., molecular data).
